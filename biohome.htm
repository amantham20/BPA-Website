                        Also called zero energy homes, bio homes are just like any home—except better. They are regular grid-tied homes that are so air-tight, well insulated, and energy-efficient that they produce as much renewable energy as they consume over the course of a
                        year, leaving the occupants with a net-zero energy bill, and a carbon-free home.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A zero energy home is not just a “green home” or a home with solar panels. A zero energy home combines advanced design and superior building systems with energy efficiency and on-site solar panels to produce a better home.

                    <h2>Benefits</h2>

                    <p>
                        breathe cleaner air, quiet indoor environment, and comfortable indoor temperatures, range in price and size, save you money from day one, durable home, certified, and climate-friendly
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        consider a zero energy ready home. These homes are designed and built to the same high standards as zero energy homes. The only difference is that zero energy ready homes are designed and wired for solar panels
                        that have not yet been installed, making them even more affordable, and allowing them to become zero energy homes when you are ready.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Cons</h2>
                    <p>Difficult to regulate the temperature of the home, costly, heavier roof, need the help of professionals to avoid issues or liabilities, takes a while to build due to rarity of materials
