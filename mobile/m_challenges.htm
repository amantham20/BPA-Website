                    <p>To ensure that homeowners meet the US Green Building Council (USGBC) or LEED ® certifications, it is a crucial step in the initial planning to check your insurance policy. The cost of replacing green upgrades to your home could not
                        be covered by a regular homeowner insurance policy. Confirm your householder policy specifically provides substitution to prevent you from paying out - of-pocket costs in order to meet the same standards. A policy on green homes
                        includes either the actual cash value or replacement costs to restore a green home approved or to upgrade a regular house to a green standard.
