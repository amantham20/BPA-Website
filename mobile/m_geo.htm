            <p> Geothermal energy is the heating and cooling system of a building using the relatively constant temperatures underground; ground soil stays at approximately 55 degrees. The system is able to pull heat from the ground into the house in the
                winter and can push heat out of the house during the summer. Along with temperature regulation, the geothermal system can also regulate humidity levels within the home.

            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> &#9633; Ground Loop: a vertical loop is the most commonly installed system. It is most advantageous when there is limited space.
                    </li>
                    <li> &#9633; Heating pump: This is installed inside your home.</li>
                </ul>

                Benefits
            </h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> &#9633; This system does not depend on the external weather. It fully regulates and exchanges temperatures with the ground and the building.</li>
                    <li> &#9633; Geothermal energy is envronmental-friendly. It lowers emissions of greenhouse gases by 60% !!</li>
                    <li> &#9633; After a while, this system can pay for itself. The investment can end up saving you 40-60% in utility costs.</li>
                    <li> &#9633; If installed properly, the geothermal heating and cooling system requires little to no maintenance or replacement for up to 50 years. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Thinking about Investing?</h1>
            <p>There are many things to consider while planning to invest in a geothermal energy system. First, you need to consider if your property is compatible and efficient for the system. Here are some guidelines and points of consideration:
                <ul>
                    <li> &#9633; Gaining EPA and state permits for acquiring the system.</li>
                    <li> &#9633; You must abide by federal, state, and local regulations on installation, usage, and maintenance.</li>
                    <li> &#9633; Find out an effective location for your indoor unit (distribution center= duct system and radiators).</li>
                    <li> &#9633; Consider installing energy-efficient windows for minimum heat and cooling leakage of the home.</li>
                    <!-- <li> &#9633; Make sure of recent home insulation.</li> -->
                </ul>
            </p>

            <div class="tips">
                <h2>
                    &#x1F4A1; Tips: Insulate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Another good way to improve your home's environmental friendliness is to make sure you use less electricity. This can be achieved by investing in insulation. Good insulation holds in your heat, so you don't need to heat your home with much energy. There
                    are different places to separate, even in the roof and inside the walls of your house. You should also consider double glazing the windows.
