                Bio homes, also called zero energy homes or green homes, are houses constructed with the maximum capability of reusable resources and energy. They create their own environment and use high-class technology to regulate usage in utilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                A zero energy home is not just a “green home” or a home with solar panels. A zero energy home combines advanced design and superior building systems with energy efficiency and on-site solar panels to produce a better home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Demand for environmentally friendly homes is rising at a phenomenal rate. According to the Green Building Council of the United States, 40% of households with single family units were green last year. In the next few years, the need for green housing
                will rise, which is forecast at 82 per cent of all residential buildings. Unfortunately, certain people do not know the characteristics to be given priority while constructing eco systems. The good news is that it is easier than it looks
                to build a green home.

                Consider a zero energy ready home. These homes are designed and built to the same high standards as zero energy homes. The only difference is that zero energy ready homes are designed and wired for solar panels that have not yet been installed, making
                them even more affordable, and allowing them to become zero energy homes when you are ready.
