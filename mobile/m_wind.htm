                Wind Power Energy Background and Basics
            </h1>
            <p>
                Wind flow in the atmosphere is caused by uneven heating surfaces of the earth, large bodies of water, and the rotation of the earth. Wind energy consists of wind turbines converting the wind flowâ€™s power moving the propellers into usable energy.

            </p>

            <h2> Components of the basic wind turbine:</h2>

            <p>

                <ul class="paralist">
                    <li>
                        &#9633; Nearest to the ground is the mount and the tower. The tower supports the rotor, drivetrain, all of the cables, and anchors the system into the ground.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &#9633; The drivetrain contains the gearbox and the generator that stores the energy created from the turbine.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &#9633; The rotor or blades of the windmill converts wind energy into rotational shaft energy. This is why the blades rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise axis.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="paralist">
                    <li> &#9633; Make sure your house is compatible with wind energy usage. Some guidelines include:

                            <li> &#9643; House is located in a rural area where a lot of wind is present. A relatively constant wind speed of at least 13 mph. Near airports, etc.</li>
                            <li> &#9643; Where other wind turbines are present</li>
                            <li> &#9643; Checking the area of your home with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state laws and regulations</li>

                    </li>
                    <li> &#9633; The general components of a wind turbine for the average house in the United States:

                            <li> &#9643; Tower= 30-60 feet</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> &#9633; Households and businesses that use wind energy as their primary source typically install 5-15 kilowatts (kW) of energy into their turbine</li>
